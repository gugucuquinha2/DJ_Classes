        // Since we want to make our sphere behave as if it is being "thrown" we should only apply the force once:

        // As such, the ForceMode should be "ForceMode.Impulse"
        // Everything else works as the previous type of movement: We give it a direction and apply a force to it (similar to the "speed" when we move the object directly via transform)
        // we use "transform.up" instead of "transform.forward" to match the weapon orientation
        Vector3 translation = transform.up;
