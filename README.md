# DJ_Classes
**Unity 2019.2.6 project with class exercises and examples.**
</br>
### HOW TO USE
1. Download the repository to your computer.
2. Open the downloaded repository folder using Unity Hub.
3. To view the examples:
    - The exercises/examples are divided by lessons/classes;
    - Each lesson has a scene and folders with the needed assets (Scripts, Prefabs, etc);
    - You can analyse the scripts which are located in the folder "Scripts" of each "Class" folder in the **Project window**;
    - The exercises are identified by "Exercise1", "Exercise2", etc... on the Hierarchy and are **disabled by default**;
    - To view the exercises/examples in action, enable the GameObject corresponding to the exercise/example you want (**you can do so in the Inspector window of that GameObject**);
    - Hit play;
    
</br>**NOTE:** I ADVISE YOU TO ONLY ENABLE 1 EXERCISE/EXAMPLE AT A TIME, SO THEY DON'T OVERLAP AND CONFUSE YOU
